     Professional Trainee II reflects the advanced level trainee through which the trainee advances as part of their progression to full performance as an independent worker. Work assignments range from the simple to the moderately complex and are generally characterized by clear and specific objectives to be reached by the application of basic methods and techniques of the occupational specialty and specific standards, guides and regulations. The primary work processes and tasks follow well-established procedures, and determinations can be made by the direct application of specific standards, guides, etc. Additional assignments are selected to develop the employee for eventual progression to the independent worker or higher level.  The Professional Worker III reflects the first independent worker level in a series of professional work. Work assignments routinely encompass problems of average difficulty and complexity, requiring the application of technical knowledge, skills and sound judgment in applying the fundamental principles, techniques, standards, policies, procedures, rules and regulations pertinent to the occupational specialty and program area. Problems encountered are usually those which can be resolved by direct application of specific standards, regulations or other similar guides. Additional assignments are selected to develop the employee for eventual progression to the fully independent worker level.  The Administrative Services Assistant provides administrative support services to the administrator of a statewide program; participates in and coordinates program planning and evaluation; conducts special studies of operational and administrative problems; and performs other duties as assigned.  A position in this class relieves the administrator of administrative details by overseeing budget preparation and expenditure control, fiscal recordkeeping and reporting and personnel services. The work also includes coordinating all program planning and evaluation, and drafting proposed legislation, policies, procedures, rules or regulations. A major activity is the conduct of special studies or investigations of operational and administrative problems or needs and the development of alternative solutions and courses of action. Such studies include feasibility and program evaluation studies which require developing background information, researching the area, analyzing the information, preparing alternative solutions and presenting recommendations orally and in writing. Such studies may be concerned with recurring situations such as applications for grants, adjusting/expanding fee schedules, etc., which require providing thorough information about budget
