As the role is our entry level, this is a great entry point for a career path at Lokad, either as a future technical expert or as manager. We help companies in different verticals (aerospace, automotive, ecommerce…) to forecast and make decisions about their inventory. The vast majority of our clients are based outside of France, mainly in North America and Europe. As a Business Data Analyst (or Supply Chain Scientist in Lokad's terminology), your role is to make sure our clients get the most from Lokad's technology. The role is a mix between technology, data crunching and supply chain expertise. You will address complex supply chain issues and craft quantitative strategies. Your goal is not only to advise your clients on strategies to adopt, but to craft and execute these strategies on a daily basis while leveraging the data available as much as possible. Your goal is also to keep refining these strategies over time to keep them aligned with the needs of our clients. At Lokad, you will benefit from the extensive training and coaching of our expert team. You will gain skills in supply chain, predictive analysis and overall quantitative optimization for business. You will learn how to achieve measurable business results grounded on scientific analysis of data. About one quarter of your time is spent interacting with clients in order to better understand their business (mainly over the phone or by mail, with occasional travels). Note that, in order to benefit from your colleagues expertise, you won't be required to work on the customers' premises. The rest of your time is spent on data analysis, including manipulating and cleaning data, setting up forecasts, economic optimization, reporting and data vizualisation. In order to do this, you'll learn to use our Differentiable Programming tools and a DSL (Envision) developped by Lokad. We are looking for candidates with the following skills and qualities: A strong engineering background. A keen interest in data and quantitative analysis in general. Good Excel skills or programming skills (e.g. Python, VBA, SQL, etc.). Impeccable command of English ( French is optional). Excellent communication skills and telephone manners. A well-made head, rather than a well-filled head. We are not looking for someone who is already an expert in supply chain or programming. We’re looking for a fast learner, with an ability to quickly grasp technology and concepts, since our technology is by no means a simple and plug-and-play product. Knowledge or understanding of supply chain would be a bonus, but the ability to quickly assess and grasp a new situation or get a clear picture of how an organization works and what are the pain points is what we are really after. Candidates must be self-motivated, confident and highly driven to achieve results with a “hands on” attitude. The role is predominantly office based, although some travel will be occasionally required to customers, partners or events. We are located in the very center of Paris, France (station Chevaleret).

What We Do, How We Do It Too often, companies use a piecemeal approach when it comes to screening drivers. They might use one vendor to help recruit. Another to screen.

At Foley, we've built a company that effortlessly manages these three areas under one roof: recruit, screen, comply.

We’ve had some years where our growth has been off the charts, like 4th fastest growing in the country. It’s not always about fastest though. Sometimes it’s about being the best, like “One of the 30 Best Firms to Work for in North America.” What is most important to us though is retention, and we know it’s tricky in the agency landscape. Some agencies are always hiring because they’re always replacing. We get it, after all, we lost two promising practitioners over the last 20 years. Of course, no firm is perfect. And we have no expectation that the next great addition to our team will be either because the only way to be the best is to stumble a little every now and then without losing your footing. So, consider T/K because we have just enough practices to stumble your way to greatness -- Technology, Healthcare, Financial Services, Food & Beverage, Franchising, Government, Lifestyle, and Environment., plenty of exposure to the services we think are most relevant today -- public relations, growth marketing, and creative services. How sweet is that? So much so our cup runneth over. Seriously, come for the culture, the experience, and the challenge. Come to live a little. Check us out at . Job Summary Trevelino/Keller is in search of a Growth Marketing Specialist who can’t wait to challenge themselves in a fast-paced integrated PR and marketing agency, supporting B2B and B2C clients.

What you don’t know, we’ll coach, train and develop along with our differentiated point of view in 360 Reputation Marketing as long as you bring the passion and eagerness to adapt in a dynamic setting. As an experienced member of the team, you balance client management with program execution. To mix things up, we will throw you into the occasional new business involvement and any one of our awesome agency initiatives. This position is the bridge between being a force on execution and balancing client expectations in a senior capacity. More than any other level, this person has the opportunity and the responsibility to lead as well as incubate less experienced staff. That is how we build the next generation of rock stars. Qualifications And Skills 4-8 years of experience in Paid Search/Paid Social campaigns Strong experience working around native advertising platforms like Google, Display, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and similar. Working technical knowledge around KPI measurement, setting up native and 3rd party reports and conversion tracking Strong experience working in Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, Search Console and other data tracking tools CRM experience a plus – HubSpot, Salesforce or similar. Comfortable engaging with clients, working with teams across multiple disciplines, developing programming, tracking budgets, and participating in the execution of programs. Ability to think on your feet, or someone else’s, so you can develop strategies including company launches, market roll-outs, new product introductions, and more.

Salary requirement is kind of important so don’t leave that blank. Then there’s commission time. We call it X10. Just introduce us to a friend, college pal, distant cousin, even a stranger that leads to business and you score 10 percent of the fees for one year. It’s a sweet deal. We have a few perks along the way, but seriously, there's really too many to mention. Let’s just say there’s a lot of free stuff, some shopping, tasty beverages, excursions, and random acts of entertainment. Lastly, our offices are in West Midtown in King Plow Arts Center. Easily the hippest [yes, we used that word] part of town. Who doesn’t want to work in a warehouse loft? It will feel like home, which by the way you can work from in our hybrid workplace model. Interested? I wouldn’t waste time. We hate to disappoint candidates. Be sure to include your salary requirement.

Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role In January 2024, Notion launched Notion Calendar, introducing the second app in the Notion suite. The launch was a massive success, and we’re now looking to grow the team. If you’re a Software Engineer interested in joining our small but mighty team to build innovative, AI-powered products that create the magic of “1 + 1 = 3”, and showcase the best of using Calendar and Notion together, please let us know! What You'll Achieve We're looking for an experienced individual contributor who enjoys working alongside other experienced engineers and designers to iterate and build across the entire stack. The ideal candidate is comfortable as a full-stack engineer, but brings backend expertise on system architecture, API design, and building scalable & robust backends. Build the core, user-facing product. You'll build the product and everything behind the scenes from the ground up, having a huge and direct impact by shipping your work to users on prod daily. Prototype new AI capabilities. You’ll work with Notion AI engineers to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into our products. Use modern web tech and influence the stack. We use React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend, and TypeScript across the full stack to build a best-in-class client and infrastructure that scales. As we build out our stack, you get to make critical choices and lay the foundations. Self-direct your work and co-own the product. You'll have autonomy and responsibility because we are all individual contributors. You'll be involved in shaping the roadmap and owning the execution of it. Create a robust and scalable backend. Build PostgreSQL database models, performant REST API with Redis cache, delta sync, and offline support using IndexedDB, 3rd party integrations, product analytics, transactional email, and service monitoring. Solve interesting technical problems. Bring your full creativity to solve super-challenging technical problems: from complex backend architecture with 3rd party integrations, real-time collaboration, syncing app state, to nifty client-side interactions. What We're Looking For You have 5+ years of engineering experience Demonstrated ability to execute with excellence: You have thrived in fast-paced environments, tackling complex technical challenges with exceptional skill and precision. Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck. Curious and quick learning: We don't expect you to have experience in every technology we use, but to learn and be productive quickly. Owning several repos and jumping into all of them doesn't scare you. Design sensibility: While you'll co-craft the interface with top designers and frontend engineers, we expect you to have a knack for great UX, such that you feel if something is off and can flag it, or better yet, polish it. Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same. Bonus Points You’re interested in productivity apps. You might use your calendar to time block, try out Chrome extensions, configure custom app launchers, or optimize your time in other ways. You've built or maintained apps using React, React Native, Electron or other frameworks. You have experience or interest in DevOps and the infrastructure side of building great software products. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you. Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation made due to a disability, please let your recruiter know. Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role The Web Infrastructure team’s mission is to own the foundation of Notion’s web-based clients and to empower engineers to build performant, scalable, and accessible product experiences within them. We’re striving for a Notion that is fast, resilient, and reliable on slow devices or with spotty connections. We’re currently using TypeScript and React and make heavy use of web technologies in all clients, including the desktop and mobile apps. What You'll Do Shape and Build: We’re running cross-company and cross-stack initiatives to make Notion faster. Recently, we’ve built things like: A wasm build of Sqlite running in a web worker to cache records on the client Lazy-loading abstractions to cut the size of our app bundle in half “In the field” aggregate profiles using JavaScript’s self-profiling APIs Lead the Industry: We want to give you the space and time to not just make Notion’s performance “acceptable” but truly redefine what a fast web application can look like. Full-Stack Expertise: You'll engage with all layers of the stack, spanning server and client environments, utilizing technologies like AWS, Postgres, NodeJS, WebSockets, React etc. No part of the stack is off-limits: Working on performance comes with an “Access All Areas” pass. Innovative solutions to our performance problems might span the client, the backend, and the networking layer in-between. What We're Looking For Impact Driven: You care about user impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not motivated to use new technologies on their own, but through careful analysis of their applicability to the problem at hand, taking into account long term implications of technical decisions. Keen Problem Observer: Have a clear and accurate understanding of context and possess a sharp eye for identifying potential problems and risks both short term and long term. Thoughtful Problem-solving: You seek to understand complex problems deeply in order to develop multiple solutions, from which you can articulate tradeoffs between user impact, timeline, scope, craft, and tech debt. Clear and Empathetic Communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and work together to find agreeable outcomes. Collaborative Team Member: You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally beyond team boundaries to accomplish shared goals. You care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same. Bonus Points You have experience optimizing the performance of client-side JavaScript. You have engaged critically with frameworks like React and maybe even developed some of your own abstractions. You previously enabled those around you to build products with better performance - by building developer tooling, benchmarks in CI, or helpful documentation. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale. Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

Read on! _________________________________________________________________________________________ We are Shape.Construction! We are digitising the largest and most fundamental industry in the world, the industry that literally builds the foundations of the civilisation we all depend on to spare us from a brutal hunter-gatherer life: CONSTRUCTION It is one of the least digitised industries in the world but also the largest – 1 in 9 people globally work in the construction industry and it constitutes 11% of global GDP. Improving construction strengthens the very foundation of human civilisation. (Watch our short film about it). We got our start as a high-end construction project management consultancy. As a consultancy, we are focused on genuinely upgrading the way construction projects are delivered. We then take the deep understanding of the projects we work on to develop construction management software products that anyone can use to deliver their projects better. We are building a full suite of products one module at a time – kind of like office 365 but for construction management. (Check out Shape, our construction management tech and watch this video about what we are doing) The core of all this is our true secret sauce; people. We only recruit the very best both in capability and personality. We are deeply focused on designing a new type of organisation that is optimised for the flourishing of the people in the team first and foremost. People that join us develop fast as a whole person in ways they never imagined. (Read more about our vision and mission). This approach has allowed us to grow from just 2 people in 2017 to over 160 today (including consultancy) and we are still very much at the beginning!

We challenge you to be your best self in all aspects of life. ________________________________________________________________________________________ 4 core values for a good life We believe a life of human flourishing is all about meaningful relationships with others and challenging yourself to create a positive impact. So our values reflect the 4 levels of relationships that each of us has: Grow yourself – Your relationship with yourself Care about people – Your relationship with others around you Execute to greatness – Your relationship with your team Build civilisation – Your relationship with humanity and the world This goes much deeper but for the sake of brevity, we will keep the summary version! We enshrined our values in our vision: We exist so that everyone in our team can thrive in a high-impact community that: Connects us with meaningful relationships Inspires us to develop ourselves to become better humans Empowers us to pursue our own learning adventures We believe that, by first doing this, we can achieve the highest levels of value for the world. And enable the achievement of our vision through our dual missions: To fully digitise the construction of human civilisation To create a new type of organisation that enables human flourishing while delivering a huge positive impact on society ___________________________________________________________________________________ The Role We are currently looking for Senior Full Stack Software Engineers who are really interested in scaling our API and pushing the limits of what a ReactJS PWA (Progressive Web App) can do.

Communication: Presents concerns, doubts or ideas publicly (speaking or writing) and with associated research (internal or external meetups, conferences).

Shape isn’t the place for you if any of the following is true: You want an easy, chilled-out role without much challenge You like to be the smartest person in the room You don’t like continuously receiving honest candid feedback You prefer to do your own thing rather than work with a team _________________________________________________________________________________________ Frequently Asked Questions Can you tell me more about what the role is like? We are in scale up mode so it will be a pretty full on role with more things to do than time available. This is why it will be important to prioritise and also develop capacity in the team by hiring and holding the team to the highest standards.

All of our roles are 100% remote and home-based. However, if you would like to work in a co-work space to get out of the house we can arrange that.

You will be supported to excel in whichever areas you are most interested in! With Shape, development is unbounded Long-term impact: We are focused on solving the biggest issues in construction project delivery in a way that can spread and outlast us A generous equity scheme: as a fast-growing consultancy as well as the fact we are building software this has a huge upside, particularly for people that stay with us through our growth ________________________________________________________________________________________ Applying properly!!

We’re a purpose-driven remote team, spread across 7 countries and 17 cities. We’re looking for a Software Engineer to ship robust and performant javascript that underpins the ambitions of charity fundraisers around the world. By joining our team, you’ll not only get to deepen your software development & architecture skills but save lives, uplift climate action, and support the most vulnerable people in our society. About The Role As part of a small feature team with 4-6 others with the support of your technical lead, you’ll be responsible for developing our product, adding new features, paying down tech debt, and ensuring code works well in production. While our engineers might specialise in front-end, or back-end, as they grow into their role they will pitch in across the full stack. Most of our code is Node on the backend (with Postgres) and React on the frontend. Raisely aims to cover all the core needs of a fundraiser. Our product covers donation processing, page builder, CRM, fundraising management and marketing automation. Our engineering team has the task of balancing the need to realise our ambitions while managing increasing sophistication of our codebase. We already facilitate millions of API requests each day, and expect that to continue growing, so you’ll be supported to write code that scales. Like all roles at Raisely, you should be an excellent communicator, believe in the values behind our customer screen, and leave your ego at the door (amplifying others is one of our 3 core values). Hours This is a full-time, permanent role. You’ll be expected to do 5 days/38hrs a week while you’re getting up to speed, then within 3 months will be eligible to move to 4 days/30.4hrs as part of our 4 Day Work Week policy.

You're a capable engineer, you produce high quality code and consider the various permutations and edge-cases. You're a manager-of-one You don't need a manager to check in and direct your workflow, you'd prefer to work to broad expectations and manage your own time within that framework. You can identify when you need a hand, and won't hesitate to ask. You ship code and see it through to p roduction You understand that there's a balance between writing perfect code and actually shipping code and you finish what you start. You're happy to adjust that code in response to feedback, and prompt the team to help you see that code through to production. You Care About Making a Difference Yeah, we’re all here because we want to make the world better (and by that we mean a utopian paradise where humanity is at peace with our neighbours, nature, and ourselves and we actively support one another to thrive together). So you’ve gotta want that too! And We’re Looking For Experience.
